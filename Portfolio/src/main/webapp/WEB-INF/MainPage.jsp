				<p>I wanted to start by saying thank you for visiting my website. If you were directed here by a job application then you know my name.
				I will not be displaying it anywhere on my page for personal protection. If you stumbled upon this page by other means, I don't trust you
				but feel free to look around on the off chance you want to hire me.<br><br>
				While navigating my page, you will discover not all features are available. If you'd like to view more than you've been given access to
				please click <a href="/login">HERE</a> or see the link at the top right of the page. It will act as a login page but will be an information 
				exchange so that I know who has visited me, and can reach out to follow up on your thoughts. <br><br>
				I created this website specifically so that I could get a more personalized message across to any possible employers.
				Normally this goal is achieved by attaching a cover letter to applications. Unfortunately, On many applications I found that I could not breach 
				this gap using a cover letter. There would be no option to attach one and the option labeled CV would take a single file that clearly needed to be reserved 
				for my resume, however, some applications did leave the option for an applicant to link a website. I hope that you enjoy exploring my website
				and consider me for hire.<br><br>
				I recently underwent training to become a software developer. I am pursuing a backend developer role but am interested in all tech positions that 
				might help lead me to that final goal. I am a determined individual on a path to kickstart my career. I hope you recognize the value in me and give 
				me the opportunity to prove it to you.
